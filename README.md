# iBook G4 Linux Config Files

This is a collection of my configuration files for Void Linux running on an iBook G4. They include:

1. A custom battery monitor for i3blocks that works with Apple's PMU
1. A custom CPU and memory history graph
1. A script that allows stream of any support youtube-dl supported site from a remote server
1. A simple script to symlink everything into place for easy installation
